For this topic, you are required to understand some of the basic image segmentation techniques such as thresholding and edge-based methods. Knowledge of clustering-based or learning-based approaches will have my respect. Image segmentation methods are extensively explained in the blog What is image
segmentation and medium article Color image segmentation - Image Processing illustrates thresholding
method in a simplified way. For edge-based methods, one needs to have an idea of Sobel filters, canny
edge detection, etc. Do not worry if these seem daunting to you. It’s all about learning and you will
have your chance to learn these fully during the task rounds.
